        "description": "This folder appears to contain materials for a Machine Learning (ML) course, specifically focusing on labs for a module likely titled \"MLT\".  There are 17 files and 1 subfolder.  The files are predominantly .docx and .pdf documents, with a few .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks).  The largest file is a PDF, exceeding 1MB.\n\nThe documents seem to be student work relating to two experiments (Ex1a and Ex1b, and potentially Ex2).  The content snippets reveal a focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing.  \n\nEx1a covers EDA, including initial data investigation and summarizing dataset characteristics using Python. Ex1b focuses on Data Preprocessing, detailing data cleaning (handling missing values and noisy data), data reduction, and data transformation techniques such as normalization (min-max and Z-score) and encoding categorical features.  There are also mentions of handling outliers and duplicates.  A separate document (Rakesh_MLT_Ex1a.docx) also briefly touches upon feature selection, mentioning correlation analysis and univariate/bivariate/multivariate analysis.  The .ipynb files are likely code implementations related to these experiments, but their contents cannot be viewed.  Finally, there's mention of an \"Ex2\" which appears to relate to Feature Selection and Extraction.\n\nIn short, the folder is a well-organized collection of student lab work centered around essential data science concepts and their practical application in Python.\n"
